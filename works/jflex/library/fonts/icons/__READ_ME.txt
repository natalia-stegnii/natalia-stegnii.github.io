Check examples.html to see all available icon symbols and it's codes.

Always add class .icon to parent element. It creates pseudo elements :before and :after for icon-font symbol.
See jflex/library/fonts/icons/icons.css to use ready classes. If there is no suitable symbol - you can add it to this CSS.

Usage example:
<a href="#" class="icon i-telegram">telegram</a>
